excerpt: 
<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-8">
  We have developed novel techniques for data integration that enable institutions to link data records efficiently. Our approaches achieve strong privacy protection providing data confidentiality during the integration process. We have designed similarity-based record linkage techniques that are scalable and robust against noise in the data.
