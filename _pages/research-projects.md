## Privacy-protecting methods for data integration

Integrating health datasets from multiple sites is vital in enabling powerful analytics and advancing clinical practice. In the data integration process, privacy is a major challenge, as sites must ensure data confidentiality. To achieve privacy current approaches mainly rely on security-based primitives (e.g., encryption, Secure Multi-party Computation - SMC). We have advanced these approaches by leveraging dimensionality reduction and similarity-based techniques to perform scalable data linkage with rigorous privacy protection. Additionally, we have proposed methods to facilitate the integration and re-use of de-identified datasets.
